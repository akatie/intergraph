=============================================================================
Bugs



=============================================================================
Fixes (non-critical bugs)

o) Fix DESCRIPTION file. It seems that igraph and network do not have to
   appear on the Suggested list.

=============================================================================
New featues (no particular order)

o) Generic functions for basic functions for attribute manipulations. Methods
   for objects of class 'igraph' and 'network'. All in S3 system. Some of
   them are now defined but hidden in the namespace (file 's3common.R').

o) A function that will automatically find all the (S3?) coercion methods. It
   could return an object that itself could be plotted as a graph of as.*.*
   functions.

o) Currently during the coercion the attributes are copied according to the
   rules specified in attrmap(). Perhaps the default choice should be to copy
   everything, and more advanced rules optional.
